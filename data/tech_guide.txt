# Nexus-Mind Technical Operator's Guide

## 1. Infrastructure Access
- **AWS:** Access is granted via IAM Identity Center (Single Sign-On). Request access via the #devops-requests Slack channel.
- **Database:** Production databases are accessible only via the Bastian Host. 

## 2. Deployment Pipeline
- We use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- **Staging:** Pushing to the `develop` branch automatically deploys to the Staging environment.
- **Production:** Pushing to `main` requires a Pull Request approval from at least one Senior Engineer.

## 3. Key Rotation
- **API Keys:** All service API keys (Stripe, OpenAI, SendGrid) must be rotated every 90 days.
- **Procedure:** Run `npm run rotate-keys --service=<service_name>` in the `ops-cli` repository.
